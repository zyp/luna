class TransactionalizedFIFO(Elaboratable):
    """ Transactionalized, buffer first-in-first-out queue.

    This FIFO is "transactionalized", which means that it allows sets of reads and writes to be "undone".
    Effectively, this FIFO allows "rewinding" its read and write pointers to a previous point in time,
    which makes it ideal for USB transmission or receipt; where the protocol can require blocks of data
    to be retransmitted or ignored.

    Attributes
    ----------
    read_data: Signal(width), output
        Contains the next byte in the FIFO. Valid only when :attr:``empty`` is false.
    read_en: Signal(), input
        When asserted, the current :attr:``read_data`` will move to the next value. The data is not
        internally consumed/dequeued until :attr:``read_commit`` is asserted. This read can be "undone"
        by asserting :attr:``read_discard``. Should only be asserted when :attr:``empty`` is false.
    read_commit: Signal(), input
        Strobe; when asserted, any reads performed since the last commit will be "finalized".
        This effectively frees the memory associated with past reads. If this value is tied to '1',
        the read port on this FIFO gracefully degrades to non-transactionalized port.
    read_discard: Signal(), input
        Strobe; when asserted; any reads since the last commit will be "undone", placing the read pointer
        back at the queue position it had after the last :attr:``read_commit`.
    empty: Signal(), output
        Asserted when no data is available in the FIFO. This signal refers to whether data is available to
        read. :attr:``read_commit`` will not change this value; but :attr:``read_discard`` will.


    write_data: Signal(width), input
        Holds the byte to be added to the FIFO when :attr:``write_en`` is asserted.
    write_en: Signal(), input
        When asserted, the current :attr:``write_data`` will be added to the FIFO; but will not be ready for read
        until :attr:``write_commit`` is asserted. This write can be "undone" by asserting :attr:``write_discard``.
        Should only be asserted when :attr:``full`` is false.
    write_commit: Signal(), input
        Strobe; when asserted, any writes reads performed since the last commit will be "finalized".
        This makes the relevant data available for read.
    write_discard: Signal(), input
        Strobe; when asserted; any writes since the last commit will be "undone", placing the write pointer
        back at the queue position it had after the last :attr:``write_commit`. This frees the relevant memory
        for new writes.
    full: Signal(), output
        Asserted when no space is available for writes in the FIFO. :attr:``write_commit`` will not change
        this value; but :attr:``write_discard`` will.

    space_available: Signal(range(0, depth + 1)), output
        Indicates the amount of space available in the FIFO. Useful for knowing whether we can add e.g. an
        entire packet to the FIFO.


    Attributes
    ----------
    width: int
        The width of each entry in the FIFO.
    depth: int
        The number of allowed entries in the FIFO.
    name: str
        The name of the relevant FIFO; to produce nicer debug output.
        If not provided, nMigen will attempt auto-detection.
    domain: str
        The name of the domain this module should exist in.
